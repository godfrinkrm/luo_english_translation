# luo_english_translation
using pretrained models in the transformers pipeline to build a luo-eng and eng-luo translation application

## Project Description
This project uses hugging face pretrained models to build a translation application for english to luo and luo to english
check out hugging face models at https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads

Gradio is used to build the interface. Gradio provides a faster and easier way to demonstrate machine learning applications

## Installation
1. You need to install pytorch first. If you are running a system with CPU only, the following command can install pytorch via pip
  
    ```
    !pip install torch==1.8.2 torchvision==0.9.2 torchaudio===0.8.2 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/lts/1.8/cpu
    ```
    
    If you have a GPU enabled computer, you probably need a different installation command, you can create it at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
    
2. Install transformers and gradio via the following command
    
    ```
    !pip install transformers ipywidgets gradio --upgrade
    ```
    
3. Clone and enjoy!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
